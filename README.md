# Jamal's Guide to Coding and Algorithms 2011

- This project was created to help people with coding and algorithms.
- All the examples presented here are implementations in Java or Python. 
- The author takes no responsibility for any misguidance or wrong answers, use at your own peril!

## How to compile

- All the code is in the '/code' directory
- I use the [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) tool to compile all the markdown to html.
- the file 'script' concatenates all the files from '/code' and outputs to 'coding.html'.
